SynergyHub: Some User Stories

A user can insert the estimated time they think they will take on a task
A user can break down a large task into smaller parts
A user can clock in and out when working on a task
A manager/user can celebrate an employee for good performance



Story 1
A user can break down a large task into smaller parts


A task should be created for an employee, and the employee should receive a notification showing the task
There should be a ‘breakdown’ button beside the task that allows the employee to breakdown tasks.
There should be a feedback slot besides the tasks that allows employee to leave any notes concerning the tasks


Story 2
A user can insert the estimated time they think they will take on a task

An employee should be able to add estimated times of completion against their tasks
The estimated time should be shared with the assignee so they know when to check in or if they have gone beyond stated times


Story 3
A user can clock in and out when working on a task

Before a user begins a task, they should clock into the system so that their time spent on the task is recorded
The user should also clock out when they are done working or they have paused working on the task
Clock in and out times will automatically reflect once they are clicked on. (will reflect time on your laptop/phone)
The total time spent will reflect against the estimated time when project is completed



Story 4
A manager can celebrate an employee/team for good performance

There will be a section for top management employees only that allows them to recognize the efforts of employees
Other users can then join in celebrating the employees once it’s posted.
